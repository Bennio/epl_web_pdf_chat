# epl_web_pdf_chat
This project aims to create a chat interface that allows users to 
interact with any website and PDF document. 
Users can upload a URL or a PDF file and start asking questions to 
the chat AI, which will analyze the content and provide relevant answers.

The chat AI is powered by ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art natural language generation model 
that can generate coherent and informative responses. 
The project also integrates web scraping and PDF parsing techniques 
to extract the key information from the website and PDF document. 
The project is intended for EPL teams who want to access and explore 
various sources of information in a fast and easy way.
